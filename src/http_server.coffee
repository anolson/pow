# Pow's `HttpServer` runs as your user and listens on a high port
# (20559 by default) for HTTP requests. (An `ipfw` rule forwards
# incoming requests on port 80 to your Pow instance.) Requests work
# their way through a middleware stack and are served to your browser
# as static assets, Rack requests, or error pages.
